      <p><i class="fas fa-quote-left fa-2x"></i>I just want to express how grateful I am to have found Malin Ekelund, web designer and developer, to completely rebuild my website from scratch. I have an international seminar and retreat business in the area of personal growth. I asked Malin to take a look at my old website that was pretty outdated and a bit old fashioned. She suggested that it needed to be brought up to modern standards in order for me to expand my business footprint on the web. So, I completely turned her loose on the project and pretty much stayed in the background as she went at completely rebuilding the website using her magical touch, insight and amazing skills. OMG when I looked at the finished product I was profoundly amazed how she had tuned into my energy and international business and created the perfect website for me to grow professionally. She created a custom-made Wordpress theme to match my content. Her simple and amazing design and use of color makes it easy for the public to read, move around and understand exactly what I am presenting. I am so happy with the result that I’ve asked her to be my ongoing website manager. She thinks progressively and I feel she has the skills to do pretty much anything that a healthy website and business needs to promote and expand itself. If you’re looking for a website designer, developer and creator I would say that Malin has the perfect skills and life experience to grow you to success in your online business and presence. I wouldn’t hesitate for a minute. She’s totally trustworthy.<i class="fas fa-quote-right fa-2x"></i></p>
